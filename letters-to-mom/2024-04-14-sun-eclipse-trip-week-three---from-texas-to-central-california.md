Hey everyone!  Well, we have not only survived three weeks in the van so far, but we have been thriving.  It is a viable option for us for a longer trip.    It is running well (although we need to get it into a shop soon for a brake job). It is super comfortable to drive, hang out, cook and sleep.  It is highly capable on and off-road, and we have had plenty of electrical power.

This week started with [Monday's eclipse](../trip-reports/2024-04-08-day17-eclipse-day.md) with Scott, Martha, and Kai.  And while it was very cloudy, we did get a couple of breaks in the clouds that let us get a glimpse of the eclipse as it developed and during totality.   After the eclipse was over, we just sat tight and enjoyed each other's company.  It was nice to have a couple of hours of down time and just hanging out.  

On [Tuesday](../trip-reports/2024-04-09-day18-leaving-texas---heading-towards-home.md) we started driving north.  stopping in Roswell, New Mexico, to visit the alien museum, where I am not convinced that there really are people that really do believe in Aliens.   We had a wonderful dispersed campsite out on hill all by ourselves.

[Wednesday](../trip-reports/2024-04-10-day19-lincoln-city---petroglyphs---white-sands.md) we drove through [Lincoln City NM](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/nm-lincoln/), Visited the [three rivers petroglyphs](https://www.blm.gov/visit/three-rivers-petroglyph-site) Visited the [Smokey the Bear Historical Park](https://www.emnrd.nm.gov/sfd/smokey-bear-historical-park/) Stopped at [McGuinnes Pistachio Land](https://pistachioland.com/) before finally arriving at [White Sands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm) to play in the dunes.   And finally camping in the wonderful [Aguirre Springs campground](https://www.blm.gov/visit/aguirre-spring-campground) above the [White Sands Missle range](https://home.army.mil/wsmr/).

[Thursday](../trip-reports/2024-04-11-day20-white-sands-area-to-joshua-tree.md) saw us climbing over [Emory Pass](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gila/recarea/?recid=82313) on our way to [Joshua Tree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/).  This was a _very_ long day, and we didn't arrive in the area of the park until late into the evening, which was fine, as it made for an easy entry to the park the next day.

[Friday](../trip-reports/2024-04-12-day21-joshua-tree-national-park.md) saw us rolling through Joshua Tree National Park and enjoying that before heading north toward Sequoia National Park, with a drive through the [Mojave Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert), and past [Edwards Air Force Base](https://www.edwards.af.mil/). 

[Saturday](../trip-reports/2024-04-13-day22-skylark-airport-to-sequoia-national-park.md) Started with a short bike ride to the neighboring glider airport for breakfast and  a beautiful drive up the east side of the [California Central Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Valley_(California))  with a visit to  [Sequoia National Park](https://www.nps.gov/seki), before settling in for the evening in Lindy's Landing RV park, outside of Kingsburg CA.

Today we will head to Petaluma, to visit my cousin Eric, then off to see our friend George and his boys, before finishing the trip home.

We were the top bidder for this quilt, so we have quite the momento from the trip.

The roar of the crowd, when the sun would peak through the clouds was pretty impressive.
