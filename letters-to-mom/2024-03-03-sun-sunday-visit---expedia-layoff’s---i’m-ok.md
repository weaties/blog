Good Evening!

I hope things are well and you feel fit and happy.     Well, the big news this week was that our CEO, Peter Kern, sent out an email to everyone in the company on Monday, letting us know that we would be doing a round of layoffs to the tune of 1500 people worldwide. This 1500 is less than the number we laid off in 2020, but still a considerable number.   The Warn filing in Washington indicated that there were 208 folks. That was a shock. By the end of the day on Monday, the folks getting laid off had an invite to a meeting with their L3 leader. (our CEO is “L1,” and his directs are “L2,”’s, and the next level down are L3’s,etc.…) scheduled for Tuesday.   And then, on Wednesday, we started having team meetings.   And, of course, there are the back channels about who has been let go and who is still here.   I’m still here, but there are some key teams that I work with that were impacted, and some are moving around and being re-aligned, that I also work with. So, we are still trying to figure out what the impact of all of that will be in the long term.

In other news, Katarina and Alex visited Mount Hood this weekend to ski with their buddies. As of this writing, they are not home yet, so I don’t have a ski report yet.  

I went to the Kraken game on Thursday night with my buddy Dave Smith. The Kraken won, and we had a good time catching up.   Dave is interested in getting into sailing with his Daughter, so we are talking about making some arrangements where he can get access to Airborne for that.  

Friday, after work, I helped Catherine load up the van with the set she had built for Into the Woods.   Then, yesterday morning, she headed to Leavenworth to install that. She is a couple of weeks ahead of her deadline, so that is well under control, which is good, as she is heading back to another round of filling in for someone off on parental leave. She starts this coming Tuesday.  

Today, I picked up a ticket to the Emerald City Comic Con and rode my bike down to the Washington State Convention Center. I had a good time. It was fun to see all of the folks dressed up. There was a lot of different merchandise to buy, and then many artists and writers interacted with the crowd, which was fun.

I didn’t do any talks or panels; maybe next year. :) 

Love ya
Dan W

Luke is getting really good with his Crunch Lab kits - he put this one together with just the slightest amount of help from me.

That is my buddy Dave sitting next to me.  And his buddies Andrew and Margaret next to him at the hockey game.
