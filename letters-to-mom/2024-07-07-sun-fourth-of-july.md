Good Morning!  And Happy Fourth of July week!

This has been a good week, I think that it helped that it was a short week!  :).  The week started out with my cousin Eric, his wife Maggie, and their daughter Sahale stopping by to spend the night, on their Big road trip.  They drove up from Petaluma for Perrin's graduation and then headed into Canada, and then stopped at our place as they slowly made their way south back toward home.   We had a wonderful visit and Dinner with them.

Tuesday, I headed into work, and then after work Catherine and I took Bob and Amy Maher out sailing in the evening, with the family of Amy's child hood exchange student.  It was a wonderful evening.
