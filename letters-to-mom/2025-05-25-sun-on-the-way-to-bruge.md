Hi All!

I hope you are well, and are finding peace and comfort in these days.  I'm writing you from my mom's place down in Sun City west.  I came down on Friday for a couple of days to see my Nephew and Niece in Flagstaff before heading down to moms place with Sue where we are hanging out before we leave for Bruge tomorrow for our bike and barge tour.   I'll try to send out more frequent updates of pics and vids, let me know if you are interested in getting those, and I will include you in the email that I send out for that.

I'm looking forward to this trip.  It's the first time I've done a "Barge" trip, and I hear nothing but good things about it.  My mom, Both of my sisters, Balin, Perrin and Alex will also be on the trip, along with a lot of other folks that I have yet to meet.  :).

Me and my new haircut.  I decided that getting one before I was included in a lot of pictures was probably a good idea.

Picked up a new-to-me bike.  Now I need to train for STP.   I rode this bike home from dropping off the MDX at the shop in Ballard, and it rides really well.  So far I am pleased with it.

We have been doing our Berkclub things for a number of years now, and I really appreciate these guys.


On Friday, Kat gave me a ride to the airport bright and early in the morning (I overslept, and was super glad that I was already packed), so I could head down to Phoenix in preparations for the trip to Bruges.  I took the shuttle from the airport up to Flagstaff/

So that's about it for this weeks little writeup - Our flight leaves tomorrow afternoon for Bruge.  There is a book I need to read on the flight as a bit of homework for some of the stuff that Balin and Judy want to work through, and the sad thing is, is that I am the one that recommended the book to them ;) 

Love ya All
Dan W
