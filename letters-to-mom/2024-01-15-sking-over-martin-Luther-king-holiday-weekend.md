Good afternoon!

I hope things are finding you all healthy, happy, and warm!   

Catherine and I took the long weekend and went up to the condo on Friday after work and spent the weekend up there.   

There had been some good fresh snow, which helped quite a bit, but no new snow fell while we were there.  Fortunately, it was good and cold, so things didn’t ice up too bad.  

On Friday night, Alex and Justine came up (Katarina had some synchro skating events this weekend, so she stayed down).   On Saturday, Diane and Sasha came up for the day as well. 

We all went out for a couple of sessions on Saturday, but it was so cold that we didn’t stay out for more than 90 minutes at a shot.  Alex and Justine decided to head down Saturday night.  So Catherine and I had the place to ourselves on Sunday and Today.  

Sunday, between skiing sessions, I put together a new blogging platform. It is still early, but it will work out well for me.  This is the first letter that I am writing using it ;) 

Today was a bluebird day, and while cold (10 degrees F), it was way more comfortable than Sat or Sunday.   

We are home now and will get things tidied up before guests show up for soup night tonight, and then tomorrow, it is back to work!

Sasha and I were in the condo as they prepared to head down the mountain.
