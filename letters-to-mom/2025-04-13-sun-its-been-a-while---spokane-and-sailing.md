Good Day!  I hope that you are happy and comfortable today, and are able to appreciate and enjoy this spring day!

It's been a while since I have written.   (Three weeks actually). sorry about the delay.  The week before last, I spent the whole week in Spokane with my mom over at Aunt Do and Uncle Tom's house while Debby and her family headed back to Pittsburgh for Do and Tom's Grandson Dylan's USA Hockey tournament.   Dylan goes to High School in Minnesota to play hockey, and this was the third year in a roll that he has played on the championship U18 team.  Next year he will be playing for the in the Junior Hockey League for the tri-cities.   So while I was at Aunt Do and Uncle Tom's we watched all of the games of the tournament.   

The week before I went to Spokane, my friend Brian and I (same guy I went to [DC](./2025-02-16-sun-washington-dc-trip.md) with) decided that we would head down to Portland for lunch.  I had seen a youtube video about the best street food in the country and Portland was on the list.  We quite enjoyed the day down there.  The weather was beautiful, and the food lived up to the expectations, and we had a beautiful walk along the river before heading home.

Sailing season has started.   The first even of the year, for us, was the Puget Sound One Design Regatta.  (POD) where we competed against 10 other J105's.  The first day we sailed with our old sails, and the second day we sailed with our brand new sails.  We did better on the first day, so we called up the sail maker, and had him come out and help us figure out the sails last week, and that helped a ton.   This weekend we are racing the Puget Sound Spring Regatta, Yesterday there was only enough wind to get a single race in, and we were 6th our of 12 boats (you can watch that [here](https://youtu.be/z-VHpb8f7AU?si=HfyC74fqlNuphosB&) if you are interested.  Today We will head back out there, hopefuly there is a bit more wind out there today :)     

This coming week I'm hoping to get some yard work in, and to get Airborne all put together for the season :) 

Love ya all
Dan W
