Good Morning! Monday, Feb 12, 2024

  

I hope that you are feeling fit and fine this morning. Things are good around here. Not too much to report. Saturday was a beautiful day, and I had the pleasure of going sailing with Tom, Butch, Stephan, and Kirk. There was enough wind for us to get around the course handling, and just as we finished, the wind shut down, so the boats behind us had to struggle to finish. We were the first J105 to finish, so that felt good. 

  

Catherine spent a good portion of the time while I was sailing, doing more pruning and work in the backyard, and things are looking good. We were looking at some of the history of the house, and we don’t think that we have ever been this far ahead of the yard maintenance this early in the season. It helps that we have the trip coming up, so we know we need to get stuff done before we leave for that.

  

The next step is to bring some mulch to help suppress the weeds. 

  

Yesterday was Super Bowl Sunday, and we had some folks over to watch the game. I grilled up some pork ribs that came out pretty well, and we had other various, sundry snacks. 

  

Katarina spent the weekend in Canada competing in her Synchro skating, and she was pretty pleased with their performance.

  

Catherine will return to work for Snohomish County in the next couple of weeks, and she looks forward to that. She likes all of the people that she works with up there.

  

The weather here is pretty gray and drizzly today. I’ll head into the office here in a little bit. 

  

Oh - btw - Peter Kern, Expedia’s CEO these last four years, has announced that he is not renewing his contract in April, and Ariane Gorin will be taking over from him. Ariane has worked for Expedia for 11 years and is one of the very few senior leaders who has any tenure at the company. She is well-regarded, and I think she will make an excellent CEO.

Friday afternoon I snuck out of work a bit early and hit the boat show with some buddies from work,

it was crazy, there was a Boston whaler for sale at the boat show that cost $1.7million.  That just seems silly.

Love you!
