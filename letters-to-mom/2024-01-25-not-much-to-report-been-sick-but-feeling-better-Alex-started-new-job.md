Good morning!  Thursday, Jan 25th, 2024

Not a _whole_ lot to right about this week, but I did want to shoot of a quick note to say hi.

Last Thursday I woke up, took a meeting, and crawled back into bed until Monday - I don’t know what came over me, but man, was I layed low.   I felt like complete crap - no energy to even get out of bed, and barely enough energy to watch YouTube or Netflix.   I was negative for the covid test that I took.   Monday I was able to get up and work, and catch up on being gone a couple of days, and that felt good, and now I am back to about 95% so that is good.

Tuesday I went to the dr. For my first colonoscopy - everything is just fine.  So that’s a relief.   And yesterday I was back in the office.

In other news, Alex started his new job on Monday at the same first that Katarina works at.  He is working on special projects, and the first project is up at the port of Everet.  So far he seems to be enjoying it, and appreciates the interesting nature of the projects that he is assigned to.

I’ve been putting a bit of money into the van to replace the house batteries.  we did have some worn out golf cart batteries, and now we have a brand new LifePo battery that is way smaller and lighter and delivers more energy then the old batteries.  This has led us on a journey of reworking the charging infrastructure in the van.  So now we have a new solar charter, a new charger for when the engine is running, and a new charger for when we are plugged into shore power.  All of these are Victron components.  I think I have one more full day of work todo to get everything installed like i want, and rewired, and then buttoned back up.

Tonight, Catherine, Katarina and I are heading over to Renton to see a play called “The Gods of Carnage” after work, so we are looking forward to that.

Love ya!
Dan W
