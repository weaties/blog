Good Morning - and Happy Belated Mother's Day to all of the mothers that read this.  

Just wanted to send a quick update and let you know what’s been going on! It’s been a busy few weeks, juggling a few different projects.

I’ve been focused on getting ready for the Oregon Offshore race – it’s a big goal, and I’m putting in the work to make sure everything is in top shape.  I will be taking the train to Portland tomorrow, Wednesday will be the final preparations, and then the race starts on Thursday.  It is 191 mile long course, with a 72 hour time limit.  I have a return flight booked for Sunday night.

Alongside that, I’ve been working on a little project called “Corvopi,” which is all about recording and sharing data from our Corvo sailboat races. The goal is to create a valuable resource for analysis – tracking performance, understanding weather patterns, and hopefully helping other sailors improve their skills. It’s a bit of a techy thing, but I think it could be really useful.

There has also been a lively discussion about the “Coyote” situation in the neighborhood, and I’m trying to stay involved and help find some solutions. It’s a complex issue, and I appreciate everyone’s perspective, but it does have people getting worked up quite a bit.

On a more personal note, Catherine and I went to Janelle’s wedding last weekend – it was a lovely celebration!   Janelle has lived next door to us since she was five years old ;) 

Just wanted to share a bit of what’s been occupying my time. Hope you’re all doing wonderfully!

Love ya all
Dan W
