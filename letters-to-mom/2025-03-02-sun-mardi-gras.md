Hello!  

I hope all is well and Calm for everyone.   

Catgherine's Dad - had a solid walk yeseterdat. Alex helped her take him to Kracken Ice Plex. Getting into/out of the car was better. They walked 3 laps inside, and some outside too. Today - we start interval training because Coach Alex is a big believer in intervals :-)

I spent a couple of days this past week feeling a bit under the weather, but I was able to boince back in time to feel great for a couple of day trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  I traveled down with Katarina, and we are having a great time so far.  I am hanging out with Bob and Kristi, and their posse that all went to Tulane together.

First things I did when I got back from Washington DC was to go to an all day sailiing seminar - it was pretty good - the presenter is a very succesful and well known Sailor by the name of Mark Laura

This is my friend Doug - our sons were in Boy Scouts together.   I went over to his house on Monday to help him make bread.  He is part of communityloaves.org.  This organizations coordinates home bakers making bread for local food banks.  Doug has donated over 800 loaves of home made bread.
