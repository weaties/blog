Good morning!  

I have been back for a week and am almost back into the swing of things altogether.  I spent Monday getting through all of the Slack and email messages that had come my way while I was off, and by the end of the day, I had all of that behind me.   The long and the short of it is that while we were gone, there were some leadership announcements (which is to be expected with a CEO transition).  But all in all, things are still much the same as they were when we left ;) 

We did have a lot of folks from all over the company descend on campus this past week, so it was a good week to have come back to the office since I got to be in the mix of things instead of trying to catch up on those happenings.     

Catherine made a wonderful soup for soup night on Monday night, and a good crowd showed up.   In the future, soup night is moving to Tuesday so I can race with Tom on Monday nights, as he will not be racing on Wednesdays this year.   It was good to see everyone, especially Luke, Freya and Kira!

On my way to work on Tuesday, the chain jumped over the low gear on my bike, Jammed in the spokes, broke four of them, and wrecked a number of the others.  I was able to un-jam things, and make my way to work, but just barely. So I left work early, rode the bus home with my bike, and then went to the local bike shop to get the necessary parts to repair the wheel.  Afterward, I headed down to the boat and met some of my coworkers, and we went out on a beautiful sail.  Making it across the sound and back before the sun even set.   Afterward, we went to Matador for dinner.  

Wednesday night I managed to get the wheel rebuilt, and the bike is working super well again :) 

This weekend I was down at the [Ridge Motorsports Park](https://www.ridgemotorsportspark.com) doing some [Lemons racing](https://racehero.io/events/24-hours-of-lemons-ridge-2024/results/1073741951?ref=app#show:detailed-info-overall-110) with Kyle, Eric, Andy and Curt.     I drove down on Friday night and spent the night in the van in Kyle's driveway.    We are racing the car that I busted up in October this weekend.   Kyle has put a lot of effort these past couple of months to find parts and rebuild it, and it is running well.  It rained pretty much all day on both Saturday and Sunday.  In spite of that, we ran very clean, with each driver keeping all four wheels on the track, and the car running strong all weekend (this might have been the best the car has ever felt, frankly). We ended the the weekend 2nd in class, and fourth overall, which we are pretty happy with.

Love ya!
