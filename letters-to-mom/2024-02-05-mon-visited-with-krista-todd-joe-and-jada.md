Good Morning! Monday, Feb 5th 2024

  

I hope the day finds you healthy and happy. Things are good here. Catherine and I had a wonderful weekend. We were thinking about going up to the condo on Friday night, but the weather was looking like crap, so we decided to stay down the hill. Alex and Katarina had a party to go to, so Catherine and I went and saw the movie Argyle at the Majestic Bay Theatre. The film was OK, but it wasn’t a finely crafted movie. It had a cute plot twist, but it couldn’t decide if it wanted to be a serious spy movie or some campy trope, so it ended up neither. It was nice to get out to see a film, though. 

  

After the movie, we went to grab a bite to eat at the Matador, and then we rode our bikes home.

  

When we arrived, Todd, Krista, and Joe were there, and shortly afterward, Jada showed up. Everyone was in town to celebrate Jada’s 20th birthday. We sat around and had a wonderful time catching up with them.

  

On Saturday, Alex and Justine headed up to the condo to go skiing, but when they got there, they realized they didn’t have a set of keys to get into the place. (They had been left in Catherine's car since that was the car they last took up there). So that gave Catherine and I an excuse to ride our bikes down to Fremont and drop the keys off with a co-worker of Alex’s who was heading up there to do some night skiing with them.

  

Catherine and I had a nice bike ride home, and then we started working on the yard. And we managed to get quite a bit done (and by we, I mean mostly Catherine). In the evening, we headed out to Chinooks to have dinner with Todd, Krista, Jada, and Joe and had a wonderful time. 

  

Yesterday was just a beautiful day here in Seattle, and Catherine and I worked some more in the yard and got a ton of pruning and cleaning done. We figured we had to get it done now because Catherine is about to start a set build that she has to have done before we head out on our road trip to Texas for the eclipse. So she will be busy, and we will be gone during some of the critical spring yard maintenance time, so we are trying to get in front of that.

  

In the evening, we met up with our friend Alan at pour Decisions.

  

Today, I am heading to work, and this evening, we have soup night. 

  

Love you

Dan W
