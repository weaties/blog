Howdy!  I hope that everyone is doing well!

This past week, my friend Brian and I went to Washington, D.C., where we walked a lot, experienced all kinds of weather (sun, rain, snow), watched the Super Bowl, visited several memorials and Libraries, and ate some wonderful food.

This was the first time that I have ever been to Washington DC, and I have to say that it was an impressive trip, and I am so glad that I had a chance to see it.  While I was there, I listened to [Libby - Democracy inÂ Chains](https://libbyapp.com/shelf/similar-3217335/page-1/3217335) and it is _really_ giving me a new insight into how things are working.  So much so, that I am re-reading it (I listened to most of it falling asleep). But between that book, seeing these great institutions, learning more about the history of our country I am developing a new lens through which to view the world.  I'll probably have more on that later.

On Tuesday of last week, Catherine moved Will to a new place, and he is really liking it a lot more. He is walking with a walker now. There is still a long way to go to get the fog out of his head, but it is coming along.

Below are some pictures - if you want to see more, you can check out the [recap](../trip-reports/2025-02-Washington-DC/recap.md) of the trip, which has a LOT more pictures and captions.

Love ya All
