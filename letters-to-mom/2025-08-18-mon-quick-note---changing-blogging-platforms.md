Hi Mom!

I hope things are going well for you and that the weather down there hasnâ€™t been too terrible. Things are pretty good hereâ€”itâ€™s been a relatively quiet week.

I missed out on sailing last Wednesday because I was on the milk run bus coming back from Spokane. They took me through Pasco, Sunnyside, Yakima, and Ellensburg before I finally rolled into Seattle. ðŸ˜‰

On Thursday, Bridget called to see if I had time for lunch while she was up from Tacoma checking on her house. It was great to catch up with her. That evening, I went out for the last race of the downtown sailing series on Dave Ewtonâ€™s boat. The wind died, and then the skies opened up on the way back inâ€”but luckily Daveâ€™s boat has a complete enclosure around the cockpit, so we stayed nice and dry.

Friday, I headed down to Renton to help my friend Arun set up a venue for a dance recital, and then I went back on Saturday to watch the show. Arunâ€™s wife teaches traditional Indian dance, and this recital was the graduation for one of her students. The style has such a deep history going back thousands of yearsâ€”I enjoyed the performance. Afterward, I met up with Catherine at our friend Mikeâ€™s 50th birthday party.

Yesterday I took a couple of buddies out sailing, then did some work on the boats. Today Iâ€™m heading down to the gym in a bit. I joined the Ballard Health Club and have been trying to get in a couple of workouts a week with Sara.

This coming weekend, Iâ€™ll be heading to Minnesota with a couple of the guys from Berkclub to visit Brandon, who moved out there with his family. Iâ€™ve been brushing up a little on Minnesota history to be ready.

And finallyâ€”starting next week, Iâ€™ll be using a new blogging platform to manage these weekly letters. So the look might change a little, but itâ€™ll still be me writing them.

Love ya,
Dan W
