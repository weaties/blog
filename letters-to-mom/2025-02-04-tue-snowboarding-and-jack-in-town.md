Hello Family and friends!  

I hope this week finds you happy and healthy!  Sorry for the tardiness in sending out this missive, but I did some prioritizing this weekend, and went snowboarding, since we had fresh snow, as well as prioritized hanging out with Jack.

On Monday, I drove Sue over to Redmond to drop her off with Amy.  Sue is in town for Amy's mom's memorial service, and was getting a ride to Ellensburg with her.  I had a nice visit with Amy, and she is doing pretty well, all things considered.    Jack came into town on Thursday for the service, and Alex gave him a ride to and from Ellensburg on Saturday.

After I dropped Sue off with Amy, I went and grabbed lunch with my buddy Brian O'Neil.  After lunch we finished booking our flights and accommodations in Washington DC.  We are flying out this Saturday morning, and will be coming back the following Friday.   We are going there to visit museums, library of congress, national archives, National portrait Gallery, and whatever else comes across our path :)    One of the projects for the rest of this week is to figure out a couple of places that we would like to make sure that we eat at, and if there are any performances that we would like to attend.  I'm really looking forward to this trip, and while I am gone, I am sure that it is going to snow here :) 

On Tuesday I went over to West Seattle to go for a walk with Tory.   After the walk, I went and got some lunch, and then hung out with TJ for most of the afternoon, before heading home for soup night (Emi made Mochi soup which was fantastic)

On Wedensday the weather continued to be fantastic, so I went for a bike ride and checked on the boats.

Thursday the weather turned to more like what we expect here in the northwest in Feb, and it was cold and cloudy :).   

Will moved into the Blue Ridge family home on Thursday, with Catherines assistance.  He is doing ok, but there is some adjustment that is taking place, and we will have to see how well he settles in there.    

While Will was moving, I had a chance to meet up with Jason and Afton, some old Tableau friends on Thursday afternoon.  It was great to catch up with them.

Thursday night Jack came into town, and we hung out and played some games.  

Friday night I headed up to the condo, as the first fresh snow in three weeks started to fall.  Saturday the conditions were much better then they had been, but by Sunday, the conditions were just wonderful.  Curt came up Sunday and we rode together all day - it was good to ride with him, and just hang out.

Yesterday Jack and I spent the day walking into Ballard to grab lunch, and then just hanging out until Matthew and Dana came to pick him up for dinner.

Today Jack and I have gone off shopping, and are going to make beef stew for soup night (stew is soup adjacent after all ;) ).  Tomorrow morning, I will take Jack to the train station for his return to Flagstaff.

Love ya all!

On Sunday before last, Matthew and Dana came over, and we visited with them on their boat (which is beautiful!) and then went for a wonderful walk through golden gardens.

Tuesday was a beautiful day to visit Tory over in West Seattle.

This is what it looks like when I turn 180 degrees from where I took the picture above.  Tory has a nice location :)

So....  the bartender got us to try this Icelandic drink.   It's cough syrup.
