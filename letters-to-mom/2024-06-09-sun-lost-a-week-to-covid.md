Hey All,

Not much to report this week.   I started feeling a bit peckish after everyone had gone home from soup night on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, I was feeling even more peckish, so I took a covid test, and it was positive.   So, the time since Wednesday has been a fog.  Since I went under on Wednesday, this is the first time I've been out of the bedroom for more than ten minutes (and there weren't those occasions).    

I did manage to get a Paxlovid prescription in my fog...  However, the pharmacy it went to didn't have any, and they had no intention of letting us know.   Catherine chased down an alternative supply, so I've been taking that.

I can't thank Catherine, Alex, and Katarina enough for being here for me.  We have been keeping our distance, and I've been isolated in the house. with the weather, the windows have been kept open, so fingers crossed that no one else in the house gets this.

This bout has been a little worse than the bout that I had in Portugal last June, and I have definitely lost my sense of smell.  \

Hopefully, I will have more energy this week, and more to say next weekend.

Love ya
