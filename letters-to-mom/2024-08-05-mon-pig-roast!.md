Good Morning!

I hope everyone is doing well! This past weekend, we hosted our fourth summer pig roast, which went off very well. We had RSVPs for about 180 folks, and based on the number of nametags we had left, we had close to 150 show up. This was the largest turnout and smoothest-running event we have ever hosted. The credit for the smoothest goes to Catherine!  She hired some help on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to help with keeping things running smoothly.

This year, guests were encouraged to add an activity to their name tags as an icebreaker, which worked really well to get people talking to folks they might not know. 

By the time the first guests started rolling in at 3:00, everything was ready, and everyone was showered. The Pig came out at 5:00 p.m., and then it was just chilling and talking. Later in the evening, we pulled out the fire pit, roasted marshmallows, and ate smores, with the last guests helping us clean up the backyard as they rolled out.  And the house was empty just before midnight.

Sunday was cleanup day.  I was up by 7:00 breaking things down, and getting things inside.   Twanda and Donello showed up at 9:30, and by noon we were pretty well cleaned up, other then some shuffling of things in the back yard, and running dishes through the diswasher.   

In the late afternoon I took Jay, Jack and Natalie out sailing on the boat.  It was a beautiful evening of sailing.   (No keepers in the crab pot though ;). )

This week it's back to getting up top speed on my new project, which so far has been going pretty well.
