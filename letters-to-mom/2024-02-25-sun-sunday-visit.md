Good morning! Sunday, Feb 25th, 2024

Well, here is hoping you are well, healthy and happy. Things are good here. It’s been something of a slow week around here.    Expedia’s campus was closed for a security sweep on Monday, so I worked from home that day and went into the office on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. I worked from home on Friday.  

Thursday was just a stunning day here in Seattle.   It was a complete spring head fake. I left work a bit early to get home in time to head out to a wonderful sushi dinner with Catherine, Alex, and Katarina Down in Ballard.   On the way home, the sun hadn’t set, the sky was blue, and the air was warm. As I walked my bike through the [Carl S English Botanical Gardens](https://ballardlocks.org/carl-s-english-garden.html) locks, it smelled so so good, with the flowering trees just starting to flower, and the buds pushing out on the rest of the trees, and the daffodils just getting ready to pop!   It was such a great feeling.   Since then, the weather has taken a turn for the winter-ish side of things again. Gray, rainy. But not wintery enough to snow up at the pass.   As a matter of fact, it is 36 degrees up there and raining at the moment.   This ski season sure feels like it has been a bust.  

Yesterday, Catherine and Katarina did a bunch of running around to get stuff for the scenery that Catherine is building for [Into the Woods](https://leavenworth.org/event/into-the-woods-icicle-creek-center-for-the-arts-4/), that will be going on at the Icicle Creek center for the arts.   They also stopped at Katarina’s house and got kitchen measurements for their cabinet-shopping expedition.  

Alex went on a _big_ bike ride yesterday. He met up with some buddies and went on a 52-mile bike ride. He was pooped when he got home last night, so he didn’t join us for our game of [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars).  

Today, I plan on heading down to the boat with the pressure washer I borrowed from Tom and getting the first round of spring cleaning in on the boat.
