Good Morning!   I hope that things are well!   

Well, I will get right into the big news of the week.  I got to work Friday morning to read an email from our new CEO sharing that the Chief Technology and Product officer, and her most senior leader, were no longer with the company effective immediately.    

Consider that this was the week of the Industry conference that we host, where the transition to our new CEO was made official, and the CTO (the one that was fired) followed that announcement with the keynote delivery of our most significant product announcements, it’s a pretty big deal.   The CTO had _all_ of the teams that do any sort of tech in the company, so this kind of shakes things up.  

At this point all we know is where the leaders that used to report to the CTO are landing, but there are a lot of other developments that will take place over the course of the summer as we figure out where things are going.

I’m OK with all of this stuff, and frankly am quite interested to see how all of this plays out over the course of the summer.

The rest of this letter will be in the captions of the pictures :)

My coworker Guru in the board room lounge area.  This whole area is one big giant indoor garden that is meticulously maintained for Barry Diller, our chariman.

This is the actual board room for Expedia - Each of the desk locations has a hidden iPad that comes up out of the table.

Heading across the locks on the way to sailing Monday night.   The flowers are so in bloom at the moment, it is just stunning!

Monday night sailing - we ended up tied with another boat, so were each awarded 5.5 points for this race.  We had good wind tonight, so we were able to finish, get off the water, and make it over to the sloop tavern for a burger and a beer.

On Tuesday we had a watch party in the atrium at work for the Explore 24 conference.  Where we saw the CEO transition, and the (now former) CTO\CPO announce our new AI future (which, frankly was a bit underwhelming when compared to the other AI related announcements that happened this week)

On Tuesday night, Scott and I went to the eastside for a celebration of life for our late coworker Joe.   This is a picture of the folks that showed up for that.  Joe was well loved.

Wed night, Susan’s team invited me to join them for dinner, and we walked down to Kerry Park.

And on Thursday night we went to the Freehold annual Gala as guests of our friends Scott and Gretchen.

I also spent a good portion of the week redesigning my kennel cabinet for the van.  And I think I have a good design for it now.   I might spend some time building on that today.

Love ya!
