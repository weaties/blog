Hey everyone,

Week two of retirement is done! I am getting into a groove with these morning walks - I can't complain about that. The weather's been gorgeous, but that means no decent snow up at the Pass, so much for my plans to get some boarding in.

Man, what a mess in DC. This felon's been in office for about five minutes, and he's already going nuts with executive orders. I'm pretty sure he's gonna use his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as a test to figure out who's loyal to him - you better use his new name for it, or you're on his bad list. Then he's killing all these DEI programs and turning government workers into snitches on each other. And don't get me started on Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense.

Had book club this week. We were supposed to talk about "Soldier of the Great War" but spent most of the time BS-ing and hearing about James getting screwed at work. We Picked "Trust" for next time - already knocked it out on my walks.

Will update: mixed bag this week. Good news is he's taking some steps with a cane and standing better. Bad news - his elbow's not healing right, so they've got him on more restrictions. New room now - 632 (206-320-4632). He's still pretty confused most of the time, and the tricky part is he knows it. They're moving him to Blue Ridge by the 30th. A recumbent bike might help him there. Who knows if it'll be permanent - just playing it by ear. He likes watching people in the lobby if anyone stops by.

On Wednesday, I went on a monster 15-mile walk and hung out at Suzzallo for a while. On Thursday, I caught this show called Bohemia at the Triple Door with Curt, Amy, and Catherineâ€”it was a pretty fun night.

Sue rolled in by train Friday - she's camping out in the van (beats a hotel). Yesterday, we knocked out 11 miles around Seattle, hit some bookstores, and then went to see Will. All this walking, reading, and hanging with friends is not a bad way to do retirement.

That's about it for now.

Tory made me breakfast on Monday - and we went for a walk in Lincoln park, and came across this troll.   I think there are five of them in this style throughout the northwest.  I know where another one is in Ballard.

Kind of have to wonder how many pictures there are of this statue out there ;)

They are at the beggining of a 6 year project to put a lid on this part of 520 - I think it will be nice when they are done.

I walked past a little door that said violin shop - at the top of the stairs I found this wonderful little store.

It was a wonderful show.  The theme was around Dvorkak getting drunk on Absinth, being visited by the ghost of Chopin and being inspired to right his 9th symphony.

So at intermission we tried the three brands of absinthe that they were offering, and had one of the fairy's from the show serve it to us ;)
