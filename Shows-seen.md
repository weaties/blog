# This is a list of the shows that we see on the trip.




- ## 2024 - March 22nd - My fair lady
	- [Community theater | Woodland Park Players | Seattle](https://www.woodlandparkplayers.org/) with Kai at the Theatre at Shoreline Community College.  mentioned in [2024-03-22-fri-day0-the-night-before-we-leave](trip-reports/2024-03-22-fri-day0-the-night-before-we-leave.md)
		- The production was pretty good - the quality of singing was all over the board, with the actor playing Eliza being far and away the best voice on the stage. Alas, the sound levels were all over the place, with some of the characters being way to loud, and some not being amplified at all.  The furniture on the set is furniture that came from our house that Catherine refinished.   They did all of their scenery work at the Gilbert and Sullivan scene shop.
