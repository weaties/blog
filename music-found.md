First leg of the trip to texas for the [2024 eclipse](2024%20eclipse.md). and we are east of Ellensberg and listening to
- [Jelly Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelly_Roll_(singer))  - I've hear _of_ Jelly Roll in the past, but have not actually listened to his music or paid attention.  I am enjoying it quite a bit.

see [24/03/06 starlink and whitepass](./trip-reports/2024-eclipse-texas-roadtrip/2024-03-16-sat-d-7-starlink-and-whitepass.md) for a complete run down of my trip to whitepass.  During the afternoon Eric, Jaron and I just hung out, and shared with each other different musicians by playing them on the TV by casting youtube videos at the TV.

- [The Main Squeeze](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-main-squeeze/489956736)
	- watched a lot of tiny desk concerts for him [The Main Squeeze - "Go To Work" [NPR Tiny Desk Contest 2021] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcXph-ZVJU4)
- [Sturgill Simpson](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sturgill-simpson/569539832)
	- Jaron is really into him.  Sturgill made five albums and retired.  He is known as a country artist, but his [sound and fury](https://music.apple.com/us/album/sound-fury/1476852029) album really gets away from that feel, and is way out there.  especially the video's associated with it (they are all Manga)
- [Post Malone](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/post-malone/966309175)
	- I'd seen this guy before, I think I had seen him on some show and kind of blew him off because of all of the face tattoos and teeth modifications.but this was the first time that I had actually listened to him, and I have to say, I was rather impressed.  another example of a good tiny desk concert [Post Malone « I fall apart » Tiny Desk concert - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMRmYab-yog)
- [Mac Miller](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/mac-miller/419944559)
	- I was impressed by the his tiny desk concert [Mac Miller: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrR_gm6RqCo) unfortunately Mac Miller is dead now.
