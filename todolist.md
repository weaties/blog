This is my list of things to do for the blog yet.

- add a jekyll theme
- add the templates so that we have consistent front matter - #done 
- use dataview to manage the index page #done
- figure out how to create the map
- create an rss feed
- Figure out what I want to do with navigation so I don't have to remember to add new posts to the [index](./index.md)
-
