Hello world!   This is Dan, and I am creating my new blog using Obsidian and GitHub pages.   This blog is intended to be a source for me to share my adventures with anyone who cares to read them.

## Trip Reports

These are the trip reports that I right every day - I don't send them anywhere but here, and currently they are not part of the RSS feed.  if I figure out how to get an RSS feed going, they will be there :)
