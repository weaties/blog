**Starting My Own Blog: A Practical Approach to Personal Content**

I'm launching this blog for a simple purpose: to share letters and photos with family and friends and document my upcoming trips.

**A Practical Solution for a Communication Problem**

I faced challenges when including photos in emails that I would create in drafts on my Mac or iPhone. It was a tedious process. Writing the content in Obsidian and then trying to add images wasn't any better.

I once documented a road trip on WordPress. It worked well enough, but I couldn't control or back up my content. WordPress owned it. I wanted to find an alternative where I had full control.  Not to mention that I needed to be online in order to write the posts, and that was sometimes just not available to me.

**Discovering New Tools: Obsidian, GitHub, and Jekyll**

It was a game-changer when I found the GitHub Publisher for Obsidian, which eased the process of including images. GitHub Publisher combined with GitHub Pages allowed me to host my content online while keeping full control.   This same setup works from my Mac as well as from my iPhone and iPad.

Jekyll templates provide flexible options for website design. They're easy to use and make content presentation a breeze.

In conclusion, this blog gives me the control to personalize my content and the convenience to manage it efficiently. Here's to more streamlined communication and documentation!
