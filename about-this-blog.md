**Starting My Own Blog: A Practical Approach to Personal Content**

I'm launching this blog for a simple purpose: to share letters and photos with family and friends and document my upcoming trips.

**A Practical Solution for a Communication Problem**

I faced challenges when including photos in emails that I would create in the application “drafts” on my Mac or iPhone. It was a tedious process. Writing the content in Obsidian and then trying to add images wasn't any better.

I documented my [2021 road trip](weaties2021roadtrip.com) on WordPress. It worked well enough, but I couldn't control or back up my content. WordPress owned it. I wanted to find an alternative where I had full control.  Not to mention that I needed to be online in order to write the posts, and that was sometimes just not available to me.

**Discovering New Tools: Obsidian, GitHub, and Jekyll**

I’ve been a heavy user of [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for a couple of years.  It has become the app I use for taking meeting notes, my daily journal, planning, etc.  and it has really infiltrated my life as the place that I keep my stuff.

It was a game-changer when I found the GitHub Publisher for Obsidian, which eased the process of including images. GitHub Publisher combined with GitHub Pages allowed me to host my content online while keeping full control.   This same setup works from my Mac as well as from my iPhone and iPad.

Jekyll templates provide flexible options for website design. They're easy to use and make content presentation a breeze.

If you wanted to host a blog on GitHub, you could skip the whole obsidian and GitHub publisher step, and just maintain all of you writings as files in GitHub, and all of the workflows that you might use for that would work.   So adoption of Obsidian is not _required_ by any stretch of the imagination, to have a blog on hosted on GitHub.

In conclusion, this blog gives me the control to personalize my content and the convenience to manage it efficiently. Here's to more streamlined communication and documentation!
