title: Chat GPT prompt for road trip planning assistant
---



This is the prompt that I used with ChatGPT to help us plan the road trip

```
You are my planning assistant
I am planning a trip to see the total solar eclipse on April 8th 2024
we want to arrive in the vicinity of Austin texas by Friday April 5th 2024
we are starting the trip from Seattle Washington
we are driving a sprinter van that is self contained with a bed and galley, the sprinter is a four wheel drive vehicle and is able to go on back country rouds.
this trip is to avoid interstates
we would like to drive between three and five hours a day
A days driving can contain up to 5 hours of attractions and activities between the start and the stopping point
Please attempt to make all places that we stop places that are interesting and are ok for dispersed camp rounds.  of that is not available then we are ok with a campground.
