title: 13 day itinerary for Seattle to Hill country art council
---



As of March 10th, 2024 - this is our rough plan for our road trip to [Ingram, Texas community page for the total solar eclipse of April 8](https://eclipse2024.org/communities/city/38964.html)  

I used this [2024-03-01-ChatGPT-prompt-for-road-trip-planning-assistant](./2024-03-01-ChatGPT-prompt-for-road-trip-planning-assistant.md) and asked it to help me with the route.  It was really good at being able to adjust things when I asked it to.  The maps sections I went through and added by hand with screen shots from google maps.

We have not yet planned the return trip.  - that will come as we head down the road.
