Howdy!

Yesterday I started the day with a short walk before breakfast with the family, then I headed out for a walk and to catch a couple of museums before meeting up with the Family again to watch the [Procession of the Holy Blood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procession_of_the_Holy_Blood) Which has got to be one of the longest running parades in the world ;) 

After the procession, I walked Mom back to the hotel before heading over to the Airbnb where Judy, Balin, and a bunch of the rest of the folks in the tour were hanging out.  Balin bought an 8-pack of gold-winning Belgian beers, so we tried those, and I get why they were gold medal winners.  Around this time, Alex showed up in town from his travels, so we headed back to the hotel with everyone, and we had a short introduction get-together and played a get-to-know-you game.  It was pretty nice, and I met a couple of the folks on the tour - I still don't know everyone's name, but that will be part of the goal of this, to get to know everyone a bit better.

The crowd broke up into smaller groups and headed out to separate dinners.  Alex, Sue, Perrin, Mom, and I went to a place with a late kitchen.

Today we get on the boat at 1:30 - and then we are off on our adventures!

Love ya all
