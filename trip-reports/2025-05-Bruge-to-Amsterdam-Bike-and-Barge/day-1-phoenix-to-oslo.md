Hello! About 36 hours ago, Sue, Mom, and I started our Journey from Mom's house in Sun City West to Europe for our Bike and Barge tour from Bruges to Amsterdam, via a 13-hour layover in Oslo. Osloâ€½  Why Oslo?  Well, the original plan was to deliver my nephew's bike and Keyboard to him in Oslo, but he changed his mind (his and his wife's place is not that big, it turns out), and by the time that was settled, it was too late to switch out flights.   Not a big deal; we stayed at the airport hotel last night and had a wonderful dinner. Today, it was an easy transition back to the flight that will take us to Brussels and then onto Bruges, where we will spend the afternoon.  We have all day tomorrow in Bruges, and half the day on Friday before getting on the Barge.  So we are planning on doing a food tour, and get some walking in when we get onto the ground there.

So far things have gone smoothly - no lost luggage, no fights with my sister or mom, no missed connections.

Love ya all!
