Making our connection to Washington in Chicago's O'hare airport.

![IMG_5178](../../attachments/IMG_5178.png)

The plane had to be de-iced before we could take off from Chicago - it was a pretty impressive operation that they have there.

![IMG_5182 1](../../attachments/IMG_5182%201.png)

Safe in Washington DC.  Now to get to our Hotel.

![IMG_5189 1](../../attachments/IMG_5189%201.png)

After we checked into the hotel, we went for a rather lengthy walk around DC to get our selves orientated.  We came across a large collection of protestors yelling "War Criminal".  and even more police.  We believe that Benjamin Netanyahu was a guest in the building they were protesting in front of.

The washington Monument was pretty impressive at night.

![IMG_5202 1](../../attachments/IMG_5202%201.png)

The Washington Monument from down in front of the Lincoln Memorial

![IMG_5203 1](../../attachments/IMG_5203%201.png)

The Lincoln memorial at night - we very much appreciated walking around in the dark and getting our bearings.

![IMG_5207 1](../../attachments/IMG_5207%201.png)

Reading the inscriptions on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial was the first hint that I had of the impact that this trip would have on me.

![IMG_5218](../../attachments/IMG_5218.png)

Checking out the Vietnam war memorial on our way to the Air and Space Museum on Sunday morning.

![IMG_5220](../../attachments/IMG_5220.png)

A statue of three soldiers looking at the memorial.  This statue is a part of the Vietnam war memorial, and was added later as traditionalists wanted to see a more traditional statue to offset the starkness of the wall of names.


![IMG_5221](../../attachments/IMG_5221.png)

The Vietnam Women's Memorial - a powerful tribute to the 11,000 women who served during the war. This bronze sculpture shows three nurses caring for a wounded soldier, telling a story often overlooked in history.

![IMG_5230](../../attachments/IMG_5230.png)

On the way to the Air and Space museum we took in the WWII memorial as well.

![IMG_5240](../../attachments/IMG_5240.png)

Another shot of the wasahington Monument.

![IMG_5249 1](../../attachments/IMG_5249%201.png)

The iconic Smithsonian Castle, with its distinctive red sandstone and Gothic spires, stands guard over perfectly manicured gardens. Built in 1855, this architectural gem serves as the historic heart of America's greatest museum complex.

![IMG_5251](../../attachments/IMG_5251.png)

Spring is on it's way!

![IMG_5254](../../attachments/IMG_5254.png)

The moon-gate in the gardens of the Smithsonian Castle.

![IMG_5259 1](../../attachments/IMG_5259%201.png)

I just liked this picture.

![IMG_5268 1](../../attachments/IMG_5268%201.png)

This is the original 1903 wright brothers flyer.

![IMG_5278](../../attachments/IMG_5278.png)

Brian reflected in the helmet of Neil Armstrongs space suit that he was in when he stepped onto the surface of the moon.

![IMG_5280 1](../../attachments/IMG_5280%201.png)

The suit has been carefully preserved.   It was quite something to see it.  There is still moon dust in embedded in it.

![IMG_5284 1](../../attachments/IMG_5284%201.png)

The National Museum of the American Indian.  This is on the list of things to visit when I next get to DC.  We didn't have enough time to do it justice.

![IMG_5285 1](../../attachments/IMG_5285%201.png)

The striking 'Three Chiefs' sculpture at the National Museum of the American Indian, dramatically lit in blue, tells the story of early American alliances between Native Americans, British, and Colonial leaders.

![IMG_5290](../../attachments/IMG_5290.png)

Dusk settles over the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial, with its commanding equestrian statue silhouetted against the evening sky. The grand marble steps and glowing lampposts create a dramatic scene at the foot of Capitol Hill

![IMG_5296 1](../../attachments/IMG_5296%201.png)

The capitol Building

![IMG_5300](../../attachments/IMG_5300.png)

The majestic Meade Memorial at dusk

![IMG_5302](../../attachments/IMG_5302.png)

We watched the first half of the Super Bowl at Penn Social

![IMG_5304 1](../../attachments/IMG_5304%201.png)

And the second half of the game we watched at Jackpot.

![IMG_5306](../../attachments/IMG_5306.png)


Walking past the MLK Memorial library on Sunday night.

![IMG_5320](../../attachments/IMG_5320.png)

Monday at the Lincoln Memorial as we headed over to Arlington National Cemetary

![IMG_5340](../../attachments/IMG_5340.png)

We had a beautiful day to visit Arlington National Cemetary

![IMG_5346](../../attachments/IMG_5346.png)

The view from the Arlington house.  This was a nice interpretive center, which explained the history and that Robert E Lee, the confederate general, wed the great grand daughter of George Washington.

![IMG_5351](../../attachments/IMG_5351.png)

Lot's and lots of gravestones.


![IMG_5352](../../attachments/IMG_5352.png)

All lined up with precision.

![IMG_5357](../../attachments/IMG_5357.png)

Arlington Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. Built in 1920

![IMG_5359](../../attachments/IMG_5359.png)

Inside the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, where rows of marble benches face the grand ceremonial stage. This solemn space has hosted our nation's tributes to fallen service members for over a century

![IMG_5364](../../attachments/IMG_5364.png)

The guard at the Tomb of the unknown soldier.  21 steps surrounded by pauses of 21 seconds each.

![IMG_5370](../../attachments/IMG_5370.png)

The changing of the Guard at the Tomb.

![IMG_5391](../../attachments/IMG_5391.png)

Twenty one seconds


![IMG_5396](../../attachments/IMG_5396.png)

The tomb from below.

![IMG_5400](../../attachments/IMG_5400.png)

The cemetery is absolutely Massive.

![IMG_5402](../../attachments/IMG_5402.png)

It goes on

![IMG_5406 1](../../attachments/IMG_5406%201.png)

And on

![IMG_5408](../../attachments/IMG_5408.png)

And on...

![IMG_5412 1](../../attachments/IMG_5412%201.png)

Ruth Bader Ginsburgs tombstone

![IMG_5416 1](../../attachments/IMG_5416%201.png)

and on.

![IMG_5428 1](../../attachments/IMG_5428%201.png)

After visiting the cemetery we walked over to the AirForce Memorial, which was quite impressive.

![IMG_5433](../../attachments/IMG_5433.png)

Another shot of the AirForce memorial


![IMG_5451 1](../../attachments/IMG_5451%201.png)

On Tuesday we headed over to the Library of Congress.

![IMG_5458 1](../../attachments/IMG_5458%201.png)

Which is absolutely Spectacular

![IMG_5466 1](../../attachments/IMG_5466%201.png)

This is the Library to Thomas Jefferson sold the library of congress after it first burned down.  In 1812 - a third of this collection was lost when the British burned the library.  They are continually replacing the volumes that were lost, but until then, those volumes are represented by white placeholders.

![IMG_5469 1](../../attachments/IMG_5469%201.png)

Quite the reading room.

![IMG_5477](../../attachments/IMG_5477.png)

The office with the Librarian of the library of congress worked until just recently.

![IMG_5481 1](../../attachments/IMG_5481%201.png)

One of four complete Gutenberg bible on parchment.

![IMG_5485 1](../../attachments/IMG_5485%201.png)

Sues friends Cindy and Andy met us for Coffee and gave us some local knowledge.

![IMG_5487 1](../../attachments/IMG_5487%201.png)

Walking through the East Market. There were some impressive Butcher stands in here.


![IMG_5493](../../attachments/IMG_5493.png)

A super lovely little bookstore.

![IMG_5492 1](../../attachments/IMG_5492%201.png)

You can see these books in the window from the street - Note: please don't burn down the bookstore.


![IMG_5494](../../attachments/IMG_5494.png)

Another shot of the eastern market as it just started snowing.

![IMG_5496](../../attachments/IMG_5496.png)

I was very impressed by the Metro system.  Clean, smooth fast, and easy.

![IMG_5503 1](../../attachments/IMG_5503%201.png)

After visiting with Cindy and Andy we headed to the Spy Museum - this is my secret identity.

![IMG_5505](../../attachments/IMG_5505.png)

They had a collection of James Bond cars.  While we didn't visit it, they had this one on display.  I was more impressed with the Spy museum then I expected to be.

![IMG_5512](../../attachments/IMG_5512.png)

When we left the spy museum we were greated by a wonderful snowy scene.

![IMG_5514](../../attachments/IMG_5514.png)

We then headed over to Kramers books for dinner and some shopping.

![IMG_5516](../../attachments/IMG_5516.png)

Inside of Kramers books

![IMG_5519](../../attachments/IMG_5519.png)

Trying to figure out where to go to now. 

![IMG_5522 1](../../attachments/IMG_5522%201.png)

Our walk back to the hotel was just lovely.

![IMG_5524 1](../../attachments/IMG_5524%201.png)

Brian missed me with his snowball ;) 

![IMG_5536](../../attachments/IMG_5536.png)

We stopped at Casta's rum bar along the way

![IMG_5542](../../attachments/IMG_5542.png)

Fortunately there are no hills in DC.

![IMG_5549 1](../../attachments/IMG_5549%201.png)

Back at the hotel.

![IMG_5669](../../attachments/IMG_5669.png)

The George Mason Memorial...   As I am reading more...  This guy was the source of some of the problems we are going to be facing with the congress of states....

![IMG_5680](../../attachments/IMG_5680.png)

The Jefferson Memorial was quite something as well.

![IMG_5686](../../attachments/IMG_5686.png)

![IMG_5714](../../attachments/IMG_5714.png)

Stopping for some snacks at a place recommended by Scott.

![IMG_5720](../../attachments/IMG_5720.png)

![IMG_5757](../../attachments/IMG_5757.png)


![IMG_5765](../../attachments/IMG_5765.png)

![CleanShot 2025-02-16 at 15.57.45@2x](../../attachments/CleanShot%202025-02-16%20at%2015.57.45@2x.png)

And the founding documents of the nation.


![IMG_5775](../../attachments/IMG_5775.png)

We then went to the Museum of American History

![IMG_5776](../../attachments/IMG_5776.png)

We didn't spend enough time there, but we did see the motorcyle that Robert Pirsig rode, with his son Chris, and documented in his book "Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance", which is one of my favorite books.

![IMG_5778](../../attachments/IMG_5778.png)

Memorial Continental Hall bathed in golden sunset light, its classical columns and sculptural details glowing warmly against the evening sky. This historic Daughters of the American Revolution headquarters building stands as an elegant example of early 20th-century neoclassical architecture in the heart of DC


![IMG_5783](../../attachments/IMG_5783.png)

The historic Old Post Office, now the elegant Waldorf Astoria Washington DC. This 1899 Romanesque Revival masterpiece continues its legacy as one of Pennsylvania Avenue's most magnificent landmarks.   

![IMG_5787](../../attachments/IMG_5787.png)

Waiting to get in Zobro's cafe for dinner - this was a recommendation from George and it was wonderful. 

![IMG_5788](../../attachments/IMG_5788.png)

A view from our seat.


![IMG_5795](../../attachments/IMG_5795.png)

And then Beers on our last night in DC at the Board Room - a bar where you can borrow and play games.

![IMG_5801](../../attachments/IMG_5801.png)

This place is across the street from the White House

![IMG_5802](../../attachments/IMG_5802.png)

And we had a wonderful breakfast there.  very classic halls of power vibe :) 

![IMG_5809](../../attachments/IMG_5809.png)

The Museum of African American history - this was our last museum of the trip, and we did not have enough time to do it justice, so it is also on the list to revisit.

![IMG_5811](../../attachments/IMG_5811.png)

A closeup.

![IMG_5824](../../attachments/IMG_5824.png)

This was a wonderful installation describing an aspect of the history of America that continues to shape and mold us.  The echoes of slavery fill our ears at every moment.

![IMG_5826](../../attachments/IMG_5826.png)

![IMG_5842](../../attachments/IMG_5842.png)

Heading home.
