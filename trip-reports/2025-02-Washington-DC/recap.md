Making our connection to Washington in Chicago's O'hare airport.

The plane had to be de-iced before we could take off from Chicago - it was a pretty impressive operation that they have there.

Safe in Washington DC.  Now to get to our Hotel.

After we checked into the hotel, we went for a rather lengthy walk around DC to get our selves orientated.  We came across a large collection of protestors yelling "War Criminal".  and even more police.  We believe that Benjamin Netanyahu was a guest in the building they were protesting in front of.

The washington Monument was pretty impressive at night.

The Washington Monument from down in front of the Lincoln Memorial

The Lincoln memorial at night - we very much appreciated walking around in the dark and getting our bearings.

Reading the inscriptions on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial was the first hint that I had of the impact that this trip would have on me.

Checking out the Vietnam war memorial on our way to the Air and Space Museum on Sunday morning.

A statue of three soldiers looking at the memorial.  This statue is a part of the Vietnam war memorial, and was added later as traditionalists wanted to see a more traditional statue to offset the starkness of the wall of names.

The Vietnam Women's Memorial - a powerful tribute to the 11,000 women who served during the war. This bronze sculpture shows three nurses caring for a wounded soldier, telling a story often overlooked in history.

On the way to the Air and Space museum we took in the WWII memorial as well.

Another shot of the wasahington Monument.

The iconic Smithsonian Castle, with its distinctive red sandstone and Gothic spires, stands guard over perfectly manicured gardens. Built in 1855, this architectural gem serves as the historic heart of America's greatest museum complex.

I just liked this picture.

This is the original 1903 wright brothers flyer.

Brian reflected in the helmet of Neil Armstrongs space suit that he was in when he stepped onto the surface of the moon.
