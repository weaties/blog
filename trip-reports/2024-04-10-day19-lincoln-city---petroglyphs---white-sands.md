We are on the 19th day of this trip.  We woke up to a beautiful sunrise outside of [Lincoln NM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_New_Mexico).   I made us some coffee, and then we headed out.    We went into the historic town of Lincoln, where Billy the Kid made his escape, but alas, it was a Wednesday and everything is open Thursday - Monday.  So we looked through the windows, and wondered the streets.  From there we headed out towards White Sands National Park.   Along the way we stopped into the Smokey the bear Museum in Capitan NM,   And then we saw the Three Rivers Petroglyphs, before stopping in at McGuinns Pistachioland, where picked up some shirts, Pistachio's and wine.  There are probably 100 billboards throughout New Mexico advertising this place, and I have to say, it far exceeded my expectations.  

From there, we went to the White Sands National Park, where we played in the Dunes for a bit.  This place is kind of strange, it's like there was a big dump of white sand on the desert floor, that is allowed to blow around in only this one particular spot.    The edges of it are so crisp...  There are dunes, and then there is desert floor.  And then, as you are amongst the dunes, sometimes the valleyt betweeen the dunes goes right to the desert floor.  

From there we came up to a Beautiful campground that we found where we had a wonderful dinner and spent the night.
